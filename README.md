# SudokuGame
Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a fully functional Sudoku game, crafted using Java and JavaFX to ensure a rich user interface and a responsive gaming experience. Emphasis was placed on implementing the game following best practices in software engineering, with a strong adherence to object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

# Object-Oriented Approach
Encapsulation: Ensured that class properties are private, with public methods to access and modify these properties, promoting a secure and organized code structure.
Inheritance: Leveraged the power of inheritance to create a hierarchical relationship between classes, facilitating code reuse and enhancing maintainability.
Polymorphism: Utilized polymorphism to abstract game functionality, allowing for flexible code that can handle future expansions or modifications with ease.
Abstraction: Employed abstract classes and interfaces to define common methods and properties, ensuring a consistent framework for all game components.
# MVC Architecture
Model: Contains all the core functionalities and data structures of the Sudoku game, including the algorithms for generating puzzles and checking solutions. The model is completely independent of the user interface.
View: Responsible for presenting the game to the user, utilizing JavaFX to create an engaging and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The view observes the model and updates the UI components accordingly.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling user input and translating it into actions performed by the model. This layer controls the game flow and ensures the view reflects the current state of the model.
# Features
Dynamic Sudoku puzzle generation with multiple difficulty levels.
Real-time validation of user inputs against Sudoku rules.
Option to undo/redo moves, enhancing the user experience.
Timer and score tracking to add a competitive edge to the game.
 # Conclusion
The development of the SudokuGame project in Java and JavaFX, guided by object-oriented principles and the MVC pattern, resulted in a robust, maintainable, and user-friendly application. This approach not only facilitated the organization and scalability of the codebase but also ensured a separation of concerns, making future enhancements more manageable.
